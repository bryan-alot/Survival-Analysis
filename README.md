# Survival Analysis on Debt Obligation Defaults

This project applies survival analysis techniques to analyze the likelihood of default on debt obligations over time. Survival analysis is a statistical approach commonly used in time-to-event analysis, and in this context, it helps us understand the time until a debt obligation defaults.

## Project Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to model and analyze the survival function of debt obligations, focusing on predicting the probability of default over time. Survival analysis allows us to estimate the time until an event (default) occurs, considering censored data where not all debt obligations may have defaulted by the end of the observation period.

### Data

The project uses a dataset containing information on debt obligations, including features such as loan amount, interest rate, term, and historical payment behavior. The dataset may also include information about economic indicators or borrower characteristics that influence default.

### Survival Analysis Techniques

Survival analysis techniques used in this project may include Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox proportional hazards model, and survival regression models. These techniques help us model the hazard rate, assess the impact of covariates on default, and make predictions about the time to default.
